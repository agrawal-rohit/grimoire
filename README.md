  ✨ An opinionated <strong>book of spells</strong> for modern developers ✨
</div>

<br />

`grimoire` is a CLI tool that takes care of the common [yak-shaving](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/a/388236) operations in modern software development through opinionated templates and tooling configurations. Building something with code is nothing short of magic, `grimoire` is essentially my personal book of magic spells _(I used to be a try-hard [Wizard101](https://www.wizard101.com/) player back in the day, which should explain all the magic metaphors)_

**Why build `grimoire`?**

I found myself spending a criminal amount of time configuring every new library, monorepo, or microservice with _"just the right tooling setup"_ before I could start writing the logic that really mattered. Add on the fact that different languages serve a particular use-case better than others _(with each language having it's own tooling ecosystem that keeps evolving)_ - the eventual ["choice paralysis"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_paralysis) was too annoying to deal with everyday.

## Features

`grimoire` sets you up with several best practices adopted in modern software development with pre-configured tooling that should cover most use-cases. `grimoire` achieves this through:

* Automatic dependency upgrades using [dependabot][]
* Automatic builds, tests, and releases with [github actions][github-actions]
* Automatically generated Readme with badges through [shields.io][shields]
* Automatically generated MIT license with [spdx][spdx-license-list]
* Automatically generated community files _(contribution guidelines, issue templates, and pull request checklists)_
* Gitflow-inspired branching setup for preview and production releases _(`next` -> development, `main` -> production, `alpha`/`beta` -> preview environments)_
* Sensible [templates][] for common use cases encountered in modern development

## Supported Languages

In addition to the general tooling listed above, `grimoire` also configures language-specific tooling to enable unit testing, type-safety, consistent code linting/formatting, and _much more_. It currently supports the following languages:

### Javascript
Great choice when building for the web _(UI libraries and frameworks for the browser. Can also be a good server-side language when executed in a JS runtime like [node][], [bun][], or [deno][])_.

* Unit testing with [vitest][]
* Commit linting with [commitlint][]
* Pre-commit checks with [husky][]
* Pre-configured package bundling using [tsdown][]
* Fast and disk-efficient dependency management using [pnpm][]
* Type-safety by default using [typescript][]
* Code linting and formatting with [biome][]
* Version management and package publishing to [npm][] using [semantic release][semantic-release]

## Usage

### Requirements

[Node.js v20+][node]

### Quickstart

You can run via [npx][] (no install required):

```bash
npx grimoire@latest --help
```

Or install globally:

```bash
npm i -g grimoire
```

Then run:

```bash
grimoire --help
```

### Spells

#### Summoning

**Summoning** creates a new project from opinionated templates so you can start writing code without worrying about the tooling, tests, and CI. You can summon a resource using the following command:

```bash
npx grimoire@latest summon <resource>
```

The details for summon command and the list of supported resources are provided in the [summoning command reference](#summon-resource).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Some workflows in the generated projects require repository secrets to be set in the GitHub project _(Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions)_. Make sure to set them to prevent [github action][github-actions] failures before releasing your code out in the world.

### Examples

#### Create a public NPM package:

```bash
npx grimoire@latest summon package \
  --name my-package \
  --lang typescript \
  --template default \
  --public
```

#### Create a private internal Typescript library:

```bash
npx grimoire@latest summon package \
  --name internal-utils \
  --lang typescript \
  --template default
```

## Commands Reference

### <span id="summon-resource"></span>`summon <resource>`

API reference for the summon command. For an overview, see [Spells](#spells) → [Summoning](#summoning).

#### <span id="package"></span>`package`

Scaffold a new `package` for one of the [supported languages](#supported-languages) with sensible defaults and development best practices.
If you're new to `grimoire`, I would recommend using the interactive CLI for a guided experience.

```bash
npx grimoire@latest summon package
```

Once you're acquainted, you can skip through most prompts by providing the values through the CLI flags directly.

  ```bash
  npx grimoire@latest summon package \
    --name my-lib \
    --lang typescript \
    --template default \
    --public
  ```

**Supported Flags**

- `--name <project-name>`: Name of the package
- `--lang <language>`: Programming language that the package is built for _(for example, `typescript`)_.
- `--template <template-name>`: The starter template for this package _(for example, `default`, `react`, etc.)_
- `--public`: Whether the package should be optimised for publishing and contributions _(sets up public registry configuration, release workflows, and community files for open-source collaboration)_.
