## Getting Help

If you have questions, ideas, or need help:
- Search existing [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/agrawal-rohit/grimoire/discussions) first
- Open a new discussion for questions and proposals
- Create a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/agrawal-rohit/grimoire/issues) for bug reports

Please be specific about your environment and include steps to reproduce issues when reporting bugs.

## Development Setup

1. Fork the repository
2. Install dependencies: `pnpm install`
3. Create a local build: `pnpm pack`
4. Test the package locally: `npx <path-to-local-build>.tgz`

The project uses:
- **Node.js** v20+ for runtime
- **pnpm** for package management
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **Biome** for linting and formatting
- **Vitest** for testing

## Making Changes

### Branching Strategy

- Create feature branches from `main`
- Use descriptive branch names: `feat/<scope>-description` or `fix/<scope>-description`
- Keep changes focused and atomic

### Commit Messages

This project follows [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
type(scope): short description

Optional longer description

BREAKING CHANGE: details (if applicable)
```

Common types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `test`, `refactor`, `perf`, `build`, `ci`, `chore`

### Pull Requests

- Run tests with coverage: `pnpm cov`
- Include tests for new features and bug fixes
- Reference related issues using GitHub keywords (e.g., `Closes #123`)
- Use a clear title and explain the why behind changes
- Keep PRs focused on a single purpose

## Testing & Code Quality

- Run tests with coverage: `pnpm cov`
- Check linting: `pnpm run lint`
- Format code: `pnpm run format`
- Run type checks: `pnpm run check`

Pre-commit hooks will automatically check your code quality. If they block your commit, run the appropriate fix commands and try again.

## Documentation

- Update `README.md` for public-facing changes
- Document new APIs, CLI commands, and configuration options
- Include examples for complex functionality
- Keep documentation consistent with code changes

Small documentation fixes (typos, clarifications) are always welcome!

## Release Process

This project uses a simple tag-driven release workflow powered by [npm trusted publishing](https://docs.npmjs.com/trusted-publishers). Push a tag, and [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) handles the rest. This same workflow is configured for projects scaffolded with `grimoire`.

### How It Works

All development happens on `main`. When you're ready to release, just push a semver tag. The tag format determines what gets published:

- **Stable releases** (`v1.2.3`) → Published to npm with the `latest` tag
- **Release candidates** (`v1.2.3-rc.1`) → Published with the `rc` tag
- **Beta releases** (`v1.2.3-beta.1`) → Published with the `beta` tag
- **Alpha releases** (`v1.2.3-alpha.1`) → Published with the `alpha` tag

### Creating a Release

Ensure `main` is ready, then push a tag:

**For a stable release:**
```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git tag v1.2.3
git push origin v1.2.3
```

**For a pre-release (RC, beta, or alpha):**
```bash
git tag v1.2.3-rc.1    # or -beta.1, -alpha.1
git push origin v1.2.3-rc.1
```

### What Happens Automatically

When you push a tag, the release workflow kicks in and:

1. Installs dependencies and builds the package
2. Publishes to npm with the appropriate tag (`latest`, `rc`, `beta`, or `alpha`)
3. Creates a GitHub Release with a changelog generated from the conventional commits using [git-cliff](https://git-cliff.org/)
4. Opens a pull request with the updated package version back into the `main` branch.

### Testing Pre-releases

After pushing a pre-release tag, you can test it before cutting a stable release:

```bash
# For grimoire itself
npx @agrawalrohit/grimoire@rc --help

# For your scaffolded projects
npm install my-package@rc
```

Found a bug? Fix it on `main` and push a new pre-release tag (e.g., `v1.2.3-rc.2`). Rinse and repeat until it's solid.

### Promoting to Stable

Once a pre-release has been tested and you're confident it's ready:

```bash
git tag v1.2.3
git push origin v1.2.3
```

### Things to Remember

- Keep `package.json` version at `0.0.0` in the repo — never bump it manually
- Don't commit version changes — CI handles that during release
- Tag format matters: `v1.2.3` for stable, `v1.2.3-rc.1` for pre-releases
- [npm trusted publishing](https://docs.npmjs.com/trusted-publishers) must be configured on npmjs.com (see repository settings for details)

## Dependencies

- Propose new dependencies via GitHub Issues first
- Consider bundle size, maintenance burden, and licensing
- Security updates and critical fixes are always welcome
- Include rationale and testing notes for dependency changes

## Proposing Templates

Grimoire uses a filesystem-based template registry organized by language and resource type. When proposing new templates, follow this hierarchy:

### Template Structure

```
templates/
├── shared/                          # Global shared files (applies to all languages)
├── {language}/                      # Language-specific directory (e.g., typescript)
│   ├── shared/                      # Language-level shared files
│   └── {resource}/                  # Resource type (e.g., package)
│       ├── shared/                  # Resource-level shared files
│       └── {template}/              # Specific template (e.g., default)
```

Files are copied in this order (files with the same name are overriden based on the copy order):
1. `templates/shared` (global)
2. `templates/{language}/shared` (language-specific)
3. `templates/{language}/{resource}/shared` (resource-specific)
4. `templates/{language}/{resource}/{template}` (template-specific)

### Template Files

- Use `.mustache` extension for templated files (e.g., `package.mustache.json`)
- Use mustache syntax for variables: `{{ variableName }}`
- The `summon` configuration is passed as the mustache context
- Non-mustache files are copied as-is

### Proposing New Templates

When proposing a new template:
1. Follow the existing directory structure
2. Include all necessary files for a complete working setup
3. Test your template with `pnpm pack` and `npx <path-to-local-build>.tgz`
4. Document what the template provides in your pull request
5. Include examples of generated output

## Security

- **Do not** report security vulnerabilities in public issues
- Use GitHub's [private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/agrawal-rohit/grimoire/security/advisories)

## Maintainer Guidelines

Some guidelines for maintainers:

- Use pull requests for all changes to `main`
- Tag format must adhere to semver standards: `vX.Y.Z` for stable releases and `vX.Y.Z-rc.N`, `-beta.N`, `-alpha.N` for pre-releases
- Only push release tags when ready — tags trigger the full release pipeline
- Keep required checks and branch protection enabled on `main` branch
- Avoid modifying automation without discussion:
  - Configuration files (`cliff.toml`, `biome.json`, etc.)
  - CI workflows (`.github/workflows/*`)
  - Release tooling

If changes to these areas are needed, open an issue to discuss first.
