# Code of Conduct

This project has adopted the **[Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct, version 2.1](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/)**.

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment‑free experience for everyone. **We expect all community members to follow these standards.**

We will strive to be welcoming, patient, and considerate in all interactions.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:

- **Be respectful** — demonstrate empathy and kindness toward others.
- **Be constructive** — give and accept constructive feedback gracefully.
- **Be inclusive** — welcome people of all backgrounds, identities, and levels of experience.
- **Be responsible** — accept responsibility and apologize when appropriate.

Examples of unacceptable behavior:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, sexual attention or advances.
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
- Public or private harassment.
- Publishing others’ private information without explicit permission.
- Any other behavior that could reasonably be considered inappropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces _(issues, PRs, project boards, chat channels, discussions, etc.)_ and also applies when an individual is officially representing the project in public spaces.

## Reporting

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, please report it immediately. Preferred options:

- Use GitHub’s reporting tools (e.g. _Report abuse_ / _Report content_ on GitHub).
- Open a private [GitHub Security Advisory](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/secure-coding/reporting-security-vulnerabilities) for security-related concerns.
- Contact the maintainers via the email listed in repository metadata.

**All reports will be handled with discretion** and investigated promptly and fairly.
